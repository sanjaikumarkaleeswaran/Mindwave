## 🌟 Key Features

### 🤖 Intelligent AI Assistant
- **Granular Model Selection** — toggle between **Llama 3.3 70B** (Smartest), **DeepSeek R1 70B** (Reasoning), **Llama 3 70B** (Fast), or **Gemma 2 9B** directly from the chat interface. Preferences are saved to your profile.
- **Multimodal Vision AI** — upload images including **Strava activity screenshots** for performance analysis. The backend automatically switches to **Llama 4 Scout** (`meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct`) — Groq's latest multimodal vision model — to analyze your data visually.
- **True Vector RAG (Document Intelligence)** — upload PDFs, TXT, or JSON files. The local Node.js server automatically chunks documents, generates 384-dimensional mathematical embeddings using `@xenova/transformers` (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`), and retrieves relevant context using cosine similarity.
- **Interactive Tool Execution** — control your Life OS via chat. Say *"I drank water"* or *"Add a running habit"* and the AI updates your tracker automatically. It can also create full structured goal plans.
- **Voice Interface (STT & TTS)** — Tap the microphone icon for **Speech-to-Text** dictation. Toggle the speaker icon for **Text-to-Speech** responses with natural voice synthesis.

### 🎯 Smart Goal Tracking
- **AI Goal Plan Creator** — describe a goal (e.g., *"I want to run a marathon in 3 months"*); the AI generates a full structured plan with category, target date, and 5–7 specific milestones.
- **Dynamic Milestone Timeline** — a beautiful visual timeline with numbered steps, due date countdowns (*"2d overdue"*), and spine connector lines.
- **Activity Logging** — click any step to open an activity modal, log what you did, and mark the step complete.
- **Calendar View** — a unified monthly grid showing all milestone due dates, color-coded by category.
- **Animated Progress Rings** — high-quality circular progress indicators on every goal card and dashboard summary.

### 📅 Advanced Habit Tracker
- **Streak & Consistency Tracking** — monitor daily progress with current/best streaks and weekly calendar heatmaps.
- **AI Habit Insights** — ask for a performance report; the AI analyzes your data to provide qualitative feedback and actionable weekly challenges.
- **Mobile-Optimized UI** — easy "tap-to-complete" interface designed for quick updates on the go.

### ✍️ Intelligent Journaling
- **Sentiment & Topic Analysis** — instant AI analysis on every entry that identifies your mood, key topics, and provides wellbeing suggestions.
- **Privacy-First Storage** — all journals are stored securely in your MongoDB instance, never used for training external models.

### 🧘 Focus & Zen
- **Pomodoro-style Timer** — built-in countdown to help you stay in flow state.
- **Ambient Soundscapes** — curated audio (Cosmic, Nature, Lo-Fi) to block distractions while you work.

### 🔔 Proactive Systems
- **Smart Notification Bell** — real-time alerts for overdue milestones, habits at risk of losing streaks, and daily reminders.
- **Global Semantic Search** — one search bar to find anything across goals, habits, and journals. Includes **vector-search** for content *inside* your uploaded PDFs.

### 🛡️ Security & Privacy
- **Self-Hosted** — you own your data, stored in your own MongoDB instance.
- **Data Portability** — Export everything (Journals, Habits, Goals, Chat) as **JSON** or **CSV**. features a visual date-range slider.
- **Privacy Controls** — "Danger Zone" in settings to permanently wipe all data and account.
- **Security Hardened** — Helmet, rate-limiting, XSS sanitization, and NoSQL injection prevention.
